# Somnus metadata overview

somnus-metadata defines the Somnus metadata standard (core release `somnus://metadata/core/2.0.0`) and ships `somnus`, a Python toolkit that reads, writes, validates, and indexes that metadata. It is a solo research-to-implementation project; the normative contract is `SPEC.md` and the rationale is `DECISIONS.md`.

## What it does

Every file managed by Somnus carries exactly one `somnus:` header. The header records identity, revision, classification, lifecycle status, authority, time, relations, claims, regions, access policy, and ingestion policy for the file. The toolkit:

- puts that header into the right place for the file type (Markdown frontmatter, a comment block in code or config, or a `<file>.somnus.yaml` sidecar) without touching the bytes around it;
- validates headers at four levels (`carrier`, `core`, `semantic`, `canon`) and prints compiler-style diagnostics;
- indexes every registered root into one global SQLite registry at `~/.somnus/somnus.db`, which tracks revisions, locations, relations, claims, and conflicts and keeps an append-only event ledger;
- offers a terminal UI (`somnus edit`) for browsing the registry and editing headers, and `somnus set` for making the same header edits from a script or an agent;
- exposes every non-interactive command to MCP clients through `somnus mcp`, a stdio server that runs the CLI for each tool call.

The package has no third-party dependencies (`pyproject.toml` declares `dependencies = []`) and needs Python 3.11 or later.

## Who uses it

- People and agents who write Markdown specifications, decision records, benchmarks, and notes and want them to be machine-readable without hand-writing headers.
- Agents that need a cheap, structured way to query "what documents exist, which is authoritative, what supersedes what". The registry answers those questions in SQL or plain text; JSON is deliberately absent (see [design decisions](../background/design-decisions.md)).
